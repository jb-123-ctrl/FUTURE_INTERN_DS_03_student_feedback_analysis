# Task 3 – Student Feedback Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes student feedback survey data to identify satisfaction trends and suggest improvements.  
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract sentiment from textual feedback and derive actionable insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze student feedback collected through surveys
- Perform sentiment analysis on text responses
- Identify positive and negative satisfaction trends
- Suggest data-driven improvements

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **pandas** – Data cleaning and analysis
- **TextBlob** – Polarity-based sentiment analysis
- **VADER Sentiment Analyzer** – Rule-based sentiment scoring
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive and accessible charts

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized student feedback collected in an academic setting.  
It includes numerical sentiment scores and textual feedback across multiple categories such as teaching, course content, examinations, labs, library facilities, and extracurricular activities.

---

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Handling missing values
3. Creation of overall satisfaction score
4. Text-based sentiment analysis using TextBlob and VADER
5. Aspect-wise sentiment analysis
6. Visualization of sentiment trends

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Teaching-related feedback shows mostly positive sentiment.
- Library facilities and examination patterns reveal higher neutral and negative sentiment.
- Extracurricular activities receive mixed responses.
- Overall student sentiment indicates general satisfaction with specific areas needing improvement.

---

## 📝 Recommendations
- Improve library infrastructure and resources.
- Review examination patterns and evaluation transparency.
- Maintain effective teaching practices through continuous feedback.
- Enhance planning of extracurricular activities.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Lexicon-based sentiment models may not capture sarcasm or context accurately.
- The dataset size is limited.
- Feedback is subjective and influenced by individual perception.
- No demographic data is available for deeper analysis.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Use transformer-based NLP models for improved accuracy.
- Expand dataset with feedback from multiple institutions or events.
- Apply topic modeling to discover hidden themes.
- Deploy the analysis as an interactive web application.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how NLP-based sentiment analysis can be applied to student feedback data to support informed decision-making and continuous improvement.
